# Project State

## Current status

Phase 3A is complete locally: Shorts Factory now has a local-only Mission
Control review dashboard. Phase 2 remains complete through Phase 2G and pushed
to `origin/main`.

## Known working capabilities

- Local mock short generation
- Real LIT API integration with safe fallback
- Controlled Playwright app recording
- Real SAPI voiceover generation
- Background music mixing
- Deterministic en-US / es-PR localization
- Local queue and scheduler
- Dry-run publisher packages
- Local Mission Control job and artifact review
- Local pending / approved / rejected / needs-revision decisions
- Receipt JSON tracking
- Green-gate autonomous phase process

## Known constraints

- Work inside Shorts Factory unless explicitly approved.
- Do not edit LIT-GhostTown unless the user explicitly asks.
- No live publishing yet.
- No real-user recording.
- No scraping.
- No cloud workers.
- No paid API dependency for core tests.
- Dry-run publisher packages require human approval before any real publishing.
- Mission Control approval records are local JSON files under `output/approvals/`.

## Current risk

Mission Control records human review state but intentionally has no export or
publishing path. Do not begin Phase 3B or add any live publisher integration
without explicit user approval.
