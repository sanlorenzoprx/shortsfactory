# Project State

## Current status

Phase 3C is complete locally: jobs can enter a human revision queue, generate a
deterministic revised job linked to the untouched original, and require a new
approval before export. No live publishing exists.

## Known working capabilities

- Local mock short generation
- Real LIT API integration with safe fallback
- Controlled Playwright app recording
- Real SAPI voiceover generation
- Background music mixing
- Deterministic en-US / es-PR localization
- Local queue and scheduler
- Dry-run publisher packages
- Local Mission Control job and artifact review
- Local pending / approved / rejected / needs-revision decisions
- Approval-gated local export bundles with deterministic replacement
- Export manifests that explicitly disable live publishing
- Human revision tasks with queued, complete, and failed local states
- Deterministic revised jobs with immutable source lineage
- Mandatory separate approval for every revised job
- Receipt JSON tracking
- Green-gate autonomous phase process

## Known constraints

- Work inside Shorts Factory unless explicitly approved.
- Do not edit LIT-GhostTown unless the user explicitly asks.
- No live publishing yet.
- No real-user recording.
- No scraping.
- No cloud workers.
- No paid API dependency for core tests.
- Dry-run publisher packages require human approval before any real publishing.
- Mission Control approval records are local JSON files under `output/approvals/`.
- Export bundles are local generated artifacts under `exports/approved/` and
  are ignored by Git.
- Revision tasks and revised job outputs remain local under `output/` and are
  ignored by Git.

## Current risk

The Phase 3C rules are intentionally narrow and not a creative rewrite engine.
Do not begin Phase 3D or add automated upload/live publisher integration
without explicit user approval.
